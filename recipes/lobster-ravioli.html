    <p>The lobster is simply enriched with mascarpone, aromatics, and fresh herbs, so the sweet lobster meat shines through in the finished ravioli. If you want to jazz it up, add some cayenne pepper, Parmesan, or saffron.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Direction</h2>

            <h5>Step1</h5>
            <p>
                Place flour in a large bowl and create a well in the center. Add eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt to well; beat using a fork to break up egg mixture. Slowly begin to incorporate flour into egg mixture, stirring from the center and gradually working outwards until shaggy pieces of dough begin to form. Use your hands to bring shaggy dough pieces together to form a shaggy ball. Transfer shaggy ball and any remaining flour in bowl to a clean work surface. Knead, pressing any loose flour into dough, until dough is smooth and elastic, 10 to 12 minutes.

            <h5>Step2</h5>
            <p>
                Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap; let rest at room temperature at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours, or in a refrigerator up to 1 day. (If refrigerating, let come to room temperature before rolling.)

            <h5>Step3</h5>
            <p>
                Place mascarpone in a small bowl; set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and shallot; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir shallot mixture into mascarpone in bowl along with herbs, lemon zest and juice, pepper, and remaining salt until combined. Gently stir in lobster. Chill, covered, for 15 minutes.
